            Gaze Tracker is my MSc project. It is a machine learning-based gaze estimation model
            built through mobile camera. The model includes a feature extraction face alignment
            model and a MLP network. By processing the image of human’s faces taken by front facing
            camera of mobile phone, the model is able to estimate their gaze points in mobile 
            phone screen.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In this project, a gaze tracking model is built through a mobile device camera. Since the
                size of the training set is 136 GB and the training time and computational power are quite
                limited, this work first considers two face alignment models, from which the better one is
                chosen to generate features for each image. this step compresses the size of the training
                data set to 2 GB. subsequently, several MLP models are built to train the predicted gaze
                points. By adding and deleting features and adding mathematical analytic solutions to
                the input, the accuracy of the model was achieved below 3 cm. Comparing the accuracy
                between different MLP models, this project also identifies a subset of features that are more
                influential for training gaze tracking models in comparison.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Finally, this project analyzes the
                possible causes of errors in this model and concludes two following points: first, the dataset
                is collected by the mobile device cameras, and thus the lighting and face dressing are more
                diverse than other datasets, which may lead to the failure of the pre-trained model to extract
                features. Second, some mathematical analytical solutions used in the training of the MLP
                network are approximate and have errors.

                The algorithm involves two parts:
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                1. Extracting features from raw frames using a pre-trained model.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Dataset pre-processing</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The dataset used in this experiment is from a previous work <em>Eye tracking for everyone</em> 
                posted in 2016. It contains 1479 zipped file and each file is named by the unique number 
                of participants. Every zipped file contains a folder of 98 frames and their corresponding
                json description file. Here is the detailed structure and descriptions of each file.
              </p>

                class="project-details__showcase-img"
              />
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first step of dataset processing is the unit conversion. The unit 
                of length taken from Apple mobile devices is point, which is the 
                absolute length and does not vary with the pixel density of the screen. 
                For example, for a conventional screen, Apple states that 1 point is 
                equal to 1 pixel, and for a Retina screen 1 point is equal to 2 pixel. 
                All units of length are converted to centimetres for calculation.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The second step is to convert the data gathered from different devices 
                into the same plain. A prediction space is defined and the camera is 
                set as (0,0) in Cartesian coordinates and the locations of dots are 
                computed in centimeters. The orientation of mobile devices are also 
                considered.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The size of dataset is around 136 Gigabyte, by which it will take several 
                months to train a deep learning model using a normal GPU. Thus the dataset 
                need to be processed and compressed before it is used to train the model. 
                The main reason is that both computational devices and time are limited 
                in this work. It is impossible and ineffective to train the model with the 
                full images. The more elegant way to achieve it is to train the model with 
                featured map of each frame. Therefore, this work requires features to be 
                extracted from the complete picture first.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                OpenFace 2.0 is implemented to finish this task. 68 face landmarks and 56 eye landmarks are extracted 
                from the original pictures.

                To compute the gaze angle, it is assumed that the eyeball to be a 
                sphere. A ray is drawn from the camera origin through the center of 
                the pupil in the image plane, and the intersection of this ray and 
                the eye-ball sphere is calculated. The point is approximate to the 
                pupil location in 3D camera coordinates.

                Several MLP networks is built by selecting different 
                input features. In best situation, the error can ne reduced to approximately 3 cm.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                By comparing the error of modal trained by different features, the following 
                features are proved to be irrelevant in gaze estimation: head pose, 
                facial expression (Facial action unit recognition), rigid face shape 
                parameters and face landmarks. The following features are proved to be 
                strongly relevant: The height and width of mobile screen and the pupil 
                location.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Another informative finding is that adding a suitable mathematical 
                analytical solution can greatly improve the efficiency of the model. 
                In many cases, using a mathematical analytic solution instead of a set 
                of eigenvalues not only improves accuracy, but also reduces the size 
                of the input matrix, making the training process much faster.
